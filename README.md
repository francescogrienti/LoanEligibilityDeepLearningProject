# LoanEligibilityDeepLearningProject
In this project I propose my deep learning model on **loan eligibility process**. The dataset is retrieved from the Kaggle's project page (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset).  
The repository is divided into the following sections: 
+ **dataset**: folder containing the raw dataset
+ **data_preprocessing**: folder containing graphs related to the exploration of the dataset
+ **nn_architecture**: folder containing a .jpeg image of the architecture of the neural net
+ **metrics**: folder containing graphs of the loss and accuracy trends of the model
+ **model**: folder containing the .py scripts of the model
  
The model still needs to be evaluated in a deeper way, the work is still in progress.
